# Implementing a P4 Calculator

The objective of this tutorial is to implement a basic calculator
using a custom protocol header written in P4. The header will contain
an operation to perform and two operands. When a switch receives a
calculator packet header, it will execute the operation on the
operands, and return the result to the sender.

## Implement Calculator

To implement the calculator, you will need to define a custom
calculator header, and implement the switch logic to parse header,
perform the requested operation, write the result in the header, and
return the packet to the sender.

We will use the following header format:

             0                1                  2              3
      +----------------+----------------+----------------+---------------+
      |      P         |       4        |     Version    |     Op        |
      +----------------+----------------+----------------+---------------+
      |                              Operand A                           |
      +----------------+----------------+----------------+---------------+
      |                              Operand B                           |
      +----------------+----------------+----------------+---------------+
      |                              Result                              |
      +----------------+----------------+----------------+---------------+
 

-  P is an ASCII Letter 'P' (0x50)
-  4 is an ASCII Letter '4' (0x34)
-  Version is currently 0.1 (0x01)
-  Op is an operation to Perform:
 -   '+' (0x2b) Result = OperandA + OperandB
 -   '-' (0x2d) Result = OperandA - OperandB
 -   '&' (0x26) Result = OperandA & OperandB
 -   '|' (0x7c) Result = OperandA | OperandB
 -   '^' (0x5e) Result = OperandA ^ OperandB
 

We will assume that the calculator header is carried over Ethernet,
and we will use the Ethernet type 0x1234 to indicate the presence of
the header.

Given what you have learned so far, your task is to implement the P4
calculator program. There is no control plane logic, so you need only
worry about the data plane implementation.

A working calculator implementation will parse the custom headers,
execute the mathematical operation, write the result in the result
field, and return the packet to the sender.
